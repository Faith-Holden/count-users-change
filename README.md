# count-users-change
My solution for Chapter 2 Exercise 4  of "Introduction to Programming Using Java".

Problem Description:
Write a program that helps the user count his change. The program should ask how many quarters the user has,
then how many dimes, then how many nickels, then how many pennies. Then the program should tell the user
how much money he has, expressed in dollars.

Notes:
TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author
to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
